### How to use
* Prepare your Ubuntu18 VM in any virtualization application. I have used VirtualBox for testing.
* Make Sure, you have Extended Feature- "Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V" is enabled in the Processor.
* Once you login to your VM, open Ternimanl and pull down Cuckoo-pre1.sh script and run it. It will install all of the Dependecies that we need for this Process.
* Once done run the below commands-
  *  source ~/.bashrc
  *  mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 cuckoo-test
  *  pip install -U pip setuptools
  *  pip install -U cuckoo
* Now pull down Cuckoo-vm script and run it. It will set up the virtual environment under which the Win7 vm will be running. It will be a headless installation.
* Once done run the below commands-
  *   vmcloak list vms
  *   cuckoo init
  *   cuckoo community
  *   while read -r vm ip; do cuckoo machine --add $vm $ip; done < <(vmcloak list vms)
  *   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.vboxnet0.forwarding=1
  *   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.*your interface name*.forwarding=1
  *   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o *your interface name* -s 192.168.56.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
  *   sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
  *   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
  *   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.56.0/24 -j ACCEPT
  *   cuckoo rooter --sudo --group opensecure
  *   cuckoo web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
